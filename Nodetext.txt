Major Issues Fixed:

Validation Logic: Changed if(!username , !Password, !Email, !FullName) to if (!username || !Password || !Email || !FullName) - you need || (OR) operator, not comma operator.
Database Query:

Fixed User.find({email}) to User.findOne({ Email }) - use findOne() for single document and match your schema field name
Fixed User.findById({username}) to User.findOne({ username }) - findById is for ObjectId, not username


Variable References:

Fixed Passwordassword typo to Password
Fixed user.password to checkUser.Password (using correct variable and field name)


HTTP Status Codes: Used proper status codes:

400 for bad requests (validation errors)
401 for unauthorized (wrong credentials)
404 for not found (user doesn't exist)
409 for conflicts (user already exists)
201 for successful creation
500 for server errors


Security: Removed password from response and avoided modifying the original user document.
Error Handling: Added proper error logging and consistent error responses.

Additional Recommendations:

Environment Variables: Make sure you have JWT_SECRET in your environment variables.
User Model: Ensure your User model schema matches the field names (Email, Password, etc.).
Input Sanitization: Consider adding input validation/sanitization middleware.
Rate Limiting: Add rate limiting for login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.

The code should now work correctly for user registration and login functionality!RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
